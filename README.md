# Museum Tour

This data repository contains all the resources to solve the following problem.  We wish to rent a bike from City Bike to bike from the Guggenheim to the American Museum of Natural History and then to the Museum of Modern Art.  Our task is to use City Bike trip data to find the closest City Bike location near each museum.
